### Scripts to automate the downloading of springer ebooks offered for free during COVID pandemic.

Download or clone this repository, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you run the Jupyter notebook, you can select the home directory and see how the ebooks are found and downloaded.

If you don't care to see under the hood, just put the `.py` file in the directory you'd like the ebooks to download, and run it.


Enjoy!

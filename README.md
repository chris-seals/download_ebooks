# download_ebooks
scripts to automate the downloading of springer ebooks offered for free during COVID pandemic

If you run this notebook it will reach out and snag all the notebooks, just specify a destination directory.

If you run the script, make sure it’s in the directory you want the books to go.

You’ll likely need to `pip install beautifulsoup4 lxml`.

Enjoy!
